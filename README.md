# Introduction
CTello is C++ library to interact with the **DJI Ryze Tello Drone** using the **Tello SDK 2.0**.
The purpuse of this project is to encapsulate the UDP socket communication and provide
a clean and easy-to-use interface to control the drone. However, CTello has no clutter
that might hide parts of the Tello communication protocol, or restrict the interaction
with the drone in any way. CTello is agnostic to the commands that are sent or received
and gives full control to the user over the drone.
